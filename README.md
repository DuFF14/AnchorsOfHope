Use this as a starter project for any similar VR architectural visualization project.

#Purpose
Visualization of potential development projects.<br>
Visualization of disparity between neighborhoods.<br>
Learning.<br>

#Contributing
This is a community project. You are welcome to contribute with your own models, scripts, scenes, etc.
The initial goal is to add models which are already freely available, although some post-processing of 3d assets will likely be needed to optimize for virtual reality.

Here is a tutorial on how to create 3d models using Google Earth and Google Sketchup: <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/learn/3dbuildings.html"> Google Building Maker Tutorial </a>

Here are a bunch of models that can be imported from Google Sketchup 3d Warehouse: <a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/search.html?q=baltimore&rsi=sbis&backendClass=entity">Baltimore 3D Models</a>
